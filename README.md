# LibreSchemas

The LibreSchemas project is a ongoing project of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), under various Copyleft licenses, that are designed to help those who identify as Neurodivergent (read more about the Neurodiversity Movement here). Libre means being “free, having liberty, at liberty” in Spanish and French. Liberty is an important principle for the Neurodiversity Movement as having free will and the right to be different in the pursuit of happiness are considered inalienable rights to most people. The Schemas part of LibreSchemas was originally derived from NeuroSchemas, an original App created by Shaun Vos, that was released in June 2021 to assist Autistic people in learning the hidden curriculum from its Social Schemas.

The mission of the LibreSchemas project is to create and make FOSS that the Neurodiverse community finds helpful as well as making it accessible for the community to learn new skills and contribute for the benefit of all Neurodiverse people. By LibreSchemas being Open Source, the source code is made freely available for modification and redistribution. This allows anyone to co-produce LibreSchemas (including anonymously) or start their own fork (a copy of some or all of LibreSchemas) even if it is discontinued.

LibreSchemas isn't currently available as a binary and isn't presently in any App stores as NeuroSchemas more than serves this purpose. If LibreSchemas was to diverge from NeuroSchemas (due to new volunteer contributions) then an App store release could be warranted. For now LibreSchemas relationship with NeuroSchemas is similar to the open source Chromium Projects relationship to the Chrome Browser. Though LibreSchemas may never be available in some App stores as the App store operator may have terms of service that are incompatible with the distribution of Copyleft licensed Software (some perceive it as too socialist). Though we have provided a App Store Exception to the license that allows the publisher to satisfy the requirements of distributing the source code through a channel without these restrictive terms of service.

LibreSchemas consists of seperate software that could be used in isolation if the appropriate software is developed. Therefore the source code has been packaged and licensed seperately with it's own GitHub repository as follows:

LibreSchemas Client https://github.com/LibreSchemas/libreschemas-client
LibreSchemas Server https://github.com/LibreSchemas/libreschemas-server-api-react
LibreSchemas Website https://github.com/LibreSchemas/libreschemas-website-react

Additionally, the datasets have three distinct GitHub repositories under the licenses of the Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0, GNU General Public License Version 3 and GNU Affero General Public License Version 3. The datasets have been licensed this way to meet different contributors needs. The datasets are in JSON format only and designed to be imported into a database such as MongoDB.
